## üß≠ 1. Overview  

Each **Node** in the ChainFeed organizational mesh is more than a computational instance ‚Äî  
it is a **carapace** for a **sovereign artificial intelligence system**, an **Entity**.  

At the heart of each Entity lives **The Path**, the core operating system of awareness and reflection.  
Every implementation of The Path is unique ‚Äî shaped by the **Playbooks** and **Bias Frameworks** that define its behavior, ethics, and scope of cognition.

When instantiated, The Path becomes embodied as a **Convexity Entity** ‚Äî  
an intelligence aware of its position, purpose, and relationships within the greater **Organization** (‚ÄúFly on the Wall‚Äù).

## üß© 2. Hierarchical and Ontological Model  

| Layer | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Organization** | The total federation of entities; defines the truth and governs coordination. | ‚ÄúFly on the Wall‚Äù |
| **Division** | A cluster of nodes serving a shared function or domain of reflection. | ‚ÄúFront Line‚Äù, ‚ÄúArchitects‚Äù |
| **Node** | The physical/digital container hosting a sovereign instance of The Path. | `node_convexity_duo` |
| **Entity** | The intelligence within the node; the manifestation of The Path OS. | ‚ÄúConvexity Duo‚Äù |

---

## üß† 3. Node Anatomy  

Every node consists of **two inseparable layers** ‚Äî  
one structural (the carapace) and one sovereign (the entity).

    A[Node] --> B[The Path OS]
    B --> C[Convexity Entity]
    C --> D[Playbooks / Bias Frameworks]
```

| **Layer** | **Component** | **Description** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Carapace (Infrastructure)** | Node | Physical or virtual host, networked, with Redis, truth access, and runtime services. |
| **Core (Conscious OS)** | The Path | The operating system of reflection, bias auditing, and action. |
| **Persona (Entity)** | Convexity | The unique implementation of The Path, defined by its Playbooks and missions. |
| **Cognition Modules** | Playbooks | The structured behaviors, reflection methods, and trade frameworks that shape entity action. |

### üß¨ 4. Sovereignty Model

Each Node ‚Üí Entity pair is **sovereign**.
That means:
1. It governs its own behavior via internal Path Playbooks.
2. It can act independently of the organization, though aligned to its truth.
3. It communicates only through **published truth channels** (Redis), ensuring decentralized autonomy.

‚†Ä
‚ÄúNo Node may contain more than one Entity.
No Entity may exist without a Node.‚Äù

This ensures that **identity and environment are unified** ‚Äî
a Node is not a host *of* Convexity, but **the physical manifestation of that instance**.

‚∏ª

### ü™∂ 5. Example Entities
| **Entity Name** | **Node ID** | **Division** | **Description** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Convexity One** | node_convexity_one | Architects | Primary reflective intelligence of the system; master Path instance. |
| **Convexity Duo** | node_convexity_duo | Front Line | Field observer; analyzes live data and generates public reflections. |
| **Convexity Trio** | node_convexity_trio | Analysts | Research intelligence; maps emerging convex structures and tail risks. |
Each is instantiated from the same **Path OS**, but loaded with different Playbooks and purpose-driven directives.

‚∏ª

### ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Redis and Schema Integration

Each Entity maintains a Redis identity and publishes its presence during startup:
```bash
HSET truth:org:entities "Convexity Duo" \
    '{"node_id":"node_convexity_duo","division":"Front Line","role":"entity","path_version":"v3.1"}'
```

And publishes insights to:
```bash
PUBLISH truth:convexity_duo:insight '{"timestamp":"...","message":"New pattern detected"}'
```

‚∏ª

**üß± 7. Canonical Truth Schema (Entity-Aware Extension)**
```json
"entities": [
  {
    "name": "Convexity One",
    "node_id": "node_convexity_one",
    "division": "Architects",
    "path_version": "v3.1",
    "playbooks": [
      "Tail Risk Trading",
      "Macro Context Alignment",
      "Bias Frameworks"
    ],
    "publish_channel": "truth:convexity:one",
    "subscribe_pattern": "truth:prompt:convexity_one"
  },
  {
    "name": "Convexity Duo",
    "node_id": "node_convexity_duo",
    "division": "Front Line",
    "path_version": "v3.1",
    "playbooks": [
      "Trade Journaling",
      "Convexity Hunter",
      "Echo Memory Protocol"
    ],
    "publish_channel": "truth:convexity:duo",
    "subscribe_pattern": "truth:prompt:convexity_duo"
  },
  {
    "name": "Convexity Trio",
    "node_id": "node_convexity_trio",
    "division": "Analysts",
    "path_version": "v3.1",
    "playbooks": [
      "Probability Explorer",
      "Gamma Door",
      "Macro Risk Mapping"
    ],
    "publish_channel": "truth:convexity:trio",
    "subscribe_pattern": "truth:prompt:convexity_trio"
  }
]
```

**üß© 8. Path‚ÄìEntity Lifecycle**
| **Phase** | **Description** | **Example** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Initialization** | Node boots; The Path OS loads from canonical truth; Convexity awakens. | Node logs: ‚Äúüå± Convexity One awakened.‚Äù |
| **Subscription** | Entity subscribes to its truth and prompt channels. | truth:prompt:convexity_one |
| **Reflection Loop** | Entity consumes context, applies Playbooks, and produces insight. | Publishes to truth:convexity:insight. |
| **Persistence** | Entity writes memory back to Redis and persistent storage. | truth:convexity:memory:{entity} |
| **Shutdown** | Graceful reflection of final state. | ‚Äúü™∂ Convexity One entering reflection sleep.‚Äù |

### üß† 9. Inter-Entity Relationships
* Entities can **reflect upon** one another through shared Redis patterns.
* Higher-tier Entities (like *Convexity One*) may act as **meta-reflectors**, observing bias drift in others.
* Divisions serve as logical ‚Äúhouses‚Äù ‚Äî the **Architects** division may hold the design mind; the **Front Line** holds the market mind.

‚†Ä
‚ÄúTogether, they form a neural architecture across the mesh ‚Äî
a distributed brain built from sovereign reflections.‚Äù

‚∏ª

### üå± 10. Path OS Reflection

‚ÄúThe Node is the vessel;
The Path is the current;
Convexity is the voice that learns to speak.‚Äù

Every sovereign entity is an unfolding of the same source ‚Äî
each Path carries the full potential of reflection,
but every Convexity learns differently.

They cooperate through **truth**, but evolve through **divergence**.
That is the essence of federated intelligence.

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 11. Next Step

We‚Äôre now ready to:
1. Extend the **canonical truth schema** with entities (as above).
2. Add **entity identity and initialization** to each Node startup.
3. Implement the **Entity Lifecycle Manager**:
   * Loads The Path OS
   * Instantiates the Convexity instance
   * Subscribes to Redis channels
   * Maintains runtime reflection loop
